## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## TypeScript Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

### Available Scripts

- `npm run lint` - Check TypeScript/React code for linting issues
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix linting issues where possible
- `npm run format` - Format TypeScript/React files with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if TypeScript/React files are properly formatted

### Configuration Files

- `.eslintrc.cjs` - ESLint configuration for TypeScript and React
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting rules
- `.eslintignore` - Files and directories to exclude from linting
- `.prettierignore` - Files and directories to exclude from formatting

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically format and lint TypeScript files before each commit:

- **Automatic Formatting**: Prettier automatically formats staged TypeScript/React files
- **Automatic Linting**: ESLint automatically fixes linting issues where possible
- **No Manual Steps**: Simply commit your changes and the hooks will handle formatting

The pre-commit hooks are configured in the root `package.json` and run via Husky.

### CI Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/format.yml`) automatically runs:
- TypeScript linting checks
- Prettier formatting checks
- PHP code formatting (Pint)
- Go code formatting (gofmt)

All checks must pass before code can be merged to the main branch.
